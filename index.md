## About the Course

- **Title:** Bioinformatics: Practical Application of Data Mining & Simulation

- **Instructor:** [Gerstein, Mark](http://www.gersteinlab.org)

- **Introduction:** Bioinformatics encompasses the analysis of gene sequences, macromolecular structures, and functional genomics data on a large scale. It represents a major practical application for modern techniques in data mining and simulation. Specific topics to be covered include sequence alignment, large-scale processing, next-generation sequencing data, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, biological database design, geometric analysis of protein structure, molecular-dynamics simulation, biological networks, normalization of microarray data, mining of functional genomics data sets, and machine-learning approaches to data integration.

## About the Final Project

- **Why:** Instead of generating papers or codes that nobody would ever read (expect for the TAs), we want to encourage the innovative generation of products that could potentially benefit the bioinformatics community. 

- **When:** Will be released officially at 14th April, and will be due at 5th May. 

- **How:** Each student will coorporate with classmates to work on three different projects. The generated codes and documents will be published on this website to be resources for later students and researches.

- **What:** Projects that are serving a main topic will be released at 14th April. Students can choose their favorite projects to work on.
